 ## commiting

when  we have to commit code we can use the following command which will open an editor of oue choice 

```sh
git commit
```

>you will need a pesonal access token to access th eremote repo from local system with username instead of password we can use PAT.


to set global  editor 

```sh
git config --global core.editor emacs
```

to use vscode as editor

```sh
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

```
wait means it tells git to wait till the file in vscode is closed

```sh
git commit -m "commit message"
```

that was for inline commit 


 ## branches

 ## Remotes

 ## Stashing


 When we want to make a file to be unstaged we can use

 ```sh
